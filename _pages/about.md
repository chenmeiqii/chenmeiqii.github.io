<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Meiqi Chen (ÈôàÁæéÁê™), a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Artificial Intelligence at Peking University (PKU), advised by [Prof. Yan Zhang](https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/szdw/zzjs/zy.htm). I also work closely with [Prof. Yixin Cao](https://sites.google.com/view/yixin-homepage) at Singapore Management University (SMU). My research interests lie in large language models and event-centric information extraction.
