<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Meiqi Chen (陈美琪), a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Peking University (PKU), advised by Prof. Yan Zhang. I also work closely with Prof. Yixin Cao at Singapore Management University (SMU). My research interests lie in natural language understanding, including event-centric information extraction, causal reasoning, and logical reasoning (especially with large language models).
